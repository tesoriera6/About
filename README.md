# About Anthony Tesoriero
### Hi, I'm Anthony.

This repository is to tell people where they can find more about me, and where they can find more of my work.
I am currently a Computer Science major, with an Aritifical Intelligence concentration, and Mathematics minor at Rowan University. This is my University GitHub account, but you can find my main GitHub at [GitHub.com/AntTesoriero](http://github.com/anttesoriero). You can also find my personal website at [AntTes.com](http://anttes.com). This website has my full resume, and just some fun stuff about me. I also use it to test different ideas, and host different web pages I may need for school. Because of this, the site is always changing, but the main page should also look generally the same.
